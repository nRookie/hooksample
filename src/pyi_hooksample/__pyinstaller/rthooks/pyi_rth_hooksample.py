# |docname| - A run-time hook for the hook sample library
# *******************************************************
#
# If some module needs extra set-up at run-time
# (e.g. setting an environment variable)
# this can be done in a *run-time hook*.
# The same *run-time hook* script might be used for several module,
# but of course should only be run once.
# This is why *run-time hooks* are to be listed in the
# :doc:`rthooks.dat <../rthooks.dat>` file.
#
# Thus dummy run-time hook does nothing useful,
# just shows that it was included.
